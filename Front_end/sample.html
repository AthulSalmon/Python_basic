        Django Introduction
    </h2>
    <h4>
        What is Django?
    </h4>
    <p>
        Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.
    </p>
    <p>
        Django takes care of the difficult stuff so that you 
        can concentrate on building your web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Django emphasizes reusability of components, also referred to as 
        DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and comes with ready-to-use features like login system, 
        database connection and CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).
    </p>
    <p style="color: red;">

        Django is especially helpful for database driven websites.
    </p>
    <h4>
        How does Django Work?
    </h4>
    
    <dl>
        <ul>
        <dt>
            Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).
        </dt>
        <dd> <li>
            Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
        </li></dd>
        <dd><li>View - A request handler that returns the relevant 
            template and content - based on the request from the user.</li></dd>
        <dd><li>Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout 
            of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.</li></dd>

    </ul>
    </dl>
    <h4>
        Model
    </h4>
    <p>
        The model provides data from the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Django, the data is delivered as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), 
        which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most common way to extract data from a database is SQL. One problem with SQL 
        is that you have to have a pretty good understanding of the database structure to be 
        able to work with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Django, with ORM, makes 
        it easier to communicate with the database, without having to write complex SQL statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The models are usually located in a file called 
        models.py.
